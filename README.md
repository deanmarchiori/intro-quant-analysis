# Introduction to Quantitative Analysis and Data Visualisation Using R

## About  

R is a popular open-source programming language used by data scientists, statisticians, social & health researchers, and many more across a wide range of disciplines. R is particularly appealing to researchers as it is free to access, designed to encourage collaborative and reproducible data analysis, and is constantly evolving to include the latest research developments. 

This two-day course is designed to equip attendees across various disciplines with the essential skills to leverage the power of R and Tidyverse for their work. The course begins with a gentle introduction to the user-friendly RStudio interface and the basics of the R coding language, or syntax. This makes it ideal for anyone with little or no prior coding experience, or those looking for a refresher of the basics. 

## Outcomes and Content  

Attendees will learn how to manipulate, transform, and clean data efficiently, and how to create compelling visualisations to communicate their findings effectively. Throughout the course, we will discuss best practices for reproducible coding. The course is designed to be highly interactive with a focus on practical applications, ensuring that you can immediately apply what you learn to your research. 

Topics covered in this workshop include:
- Introduction to R using the RStudio interface
- Introduction to data management in R (including how to import data, how to tidy data and how to transform it ready for analysis)
- Data visualisation using ggplot2
- Exploratory data analysis and how to create clear summary tables
- Introduction to RMarkdown to create high quality documents to communicate results
- Best practices for reproducible research
