# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the course materials for the **Introduction to Quantitative Analysis and Data Visualisation Using R** course. 

This course is designed to equip you with the essential skills to leverage the power of R and Tidyverse. The course begins with a gentle introduction to the user-friendly RStudio interface and the basics of the R coding language, or syntax. This makes it ideal for anyone with little or no prior coding experience, or those looking for a refresher of the basics.

Through this course, you will learn how to manipulate, transform, and clean data efficiently, and how to create compelling visualisations to communicate your findings effectively. Throughout the course, we will discuss best practices for reproducible coding. 

## How to use this book
This book provides a combination of written explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to allow you to practice what you have learned. 

Code examples will be provided in code blocks, such as this one:

```{r}
#| label: code-block-example
#| eval: false

1 + 1
```

Code in these blocks can be copied and pasted into your R session to save time when coding. We recommend typing the code yourself to familiarise yourself with the coding process and use the copy option if you are really stuck! 

Throughout the book, you will see colour-coded boxes which are used to highlight important points, give warnings, or give tips such as keyboard shortcuts.

:::{.callout-note}
These boxes will be used to highlight important messages, supplementing the main text.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Hint

These boxes will contain useful hints, such as keyboard shortcuts, that can make your coding life a little easier!
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
These boxes will contain warnings and highlight areas where you need to be more cautious in your coding or analysis.
